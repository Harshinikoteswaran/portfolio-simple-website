# portfolio-simple-website
This is my first ever simple project as a part of the full stack course at Error Makes Clever.

## About the Project

This website was created as a part of my full-stack development course. Though simple, it reflects my personality, aspirations, and the beginning of my journey in web development.

 ## It currently includes:
- Home Page – A brief introduction about me and my goals
- Contact Page – A simple way to get in touch 

## Tech Stack
 
- HTML
- CSS

## Future Plans

- Add a Projects section to showcase what I build next  
- Make the layout responsive  
- Add more interactivity with JavaScript  
- Host it live on GitHub Pages or Netlify

 ## A Note from Me

This is just the beginning. I’m learning every day and can’t wait to look back at this site months from now and smile at how far I’ve come.

Feel free to fork this if you're starting out too. Let’s grow together!
